# 2022/09/26 Activity and 2022/10/05 Activity
by Christine M. Martonia

=======      2022/09/26 Activity      ========
 This activity will be about ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap implementation discussed last week.

        1. Create a program that will continuously ask the user for a selection (menu). Implement these in ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap implementation
                A. Add number - adds a number to the list/set/map
                B. Remove number - removes a number from the list/set/map
                C. Display numbers - display the numbers added to the list/set/map
                D. Clear numbers - clears the contents added to the list/set/map
                E. Exit

        2. Add conditions depending on the implementation of the program

        ArrayList: if the added number is negative, don't allow adding the number and display a message.

        HashSet: If the added number is already present on the HashSet, don't allow adding the number and display a message.

        HashMap: If the added number is a prime number, don't allow adding the number and display a message.

=======     2022/10/05 Activity     ========
 Continue with the activity from Monday. Use the same repository.

        1. Create a class with at least 2 properties, and also your own Exception class.
        2. In the Main Class, there will be a number input that will ask the user how many objects to create.
        3. Put the objects inside an array of objects created, you can use ArrayList and use the class that you created as the object.
        4. Ask for user input for the values of the properties (ex. Name, Age for Person class). All the objects created must have values.
        5. Think of two scenarios to prevent and implement  try catch. (ex. Name should be string or should not contain special characters etc.)

        You can create or use the Main class used from Monday. Submit with the repository link.
